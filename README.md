## Author's Note
Thanks so much for checking out Deform! It's been my passion project since 2016 and has undergone **4 rewrites**! For a long time I planned to charge money for this tool, but I've decided to release it for free for a few reasons:

1. I'm self-taught and still quite young. I take pride in this, but it's made it hard to "get a foot in the door". I don't have a college to help me get an internship or a degree to vouch for my skill so I need to show my programming prowess by making badass projects. I *could* sell Deform but I see that as a short-term solution. My long-term goal is to make awesome tools for an awesome company. Making my projects free and open-source is the best way to get my code in the hands of a possible employer.
2. I wouldn't have been able to make this tool if the game-dev community wasn't so supportive. I want to give back to the community in some way.
3. Now that it's open-source other people can contribute to the project! I think Deform is awesome right now, but there's always room for improvement and I'm excited to see what cool stuff people want add!

**If you you work at, or know an awesome studio that is looking for an intern or junior developer, please reach out!**
